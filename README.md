# SWAT ELITE FORCE: FIRST RESPONDERS #

SEF First Responders is coming along with the idea of a realistic and cinematic gameplay modification of Swat Elite Force. 
SEF 7.0 by Eezstreet is the base mod in which my mod starts , the only possible way to play Swat 4 nowadays. 
My idea is to expand the concept and explore boundaries of the visual assets and tactical gameplay.
New 3d models for weapons , equipment and environment combined with realistic sounds , weapon handling , slower pace gameplay and AI tweaks to make Swat 4 feel more "heavy" and "dangerous" than any other Swat 4 experience you had before.

Make sure to sure to join "SEF: First Responders" server on Discord for feedbacks, bug reports and coop game making!
